This is a simple Radius Accounting Server based on Rafael R. Sevilla's and Ben Klangs work.

I've redone some code and added tests.
* I decoupled the dictionary from the packet parsing.
* I added authenticator handling

Missing Features right now:
* Vendor Specific Attributes

The lib/auth.rb is legacy and is only kept for future work on authorization.
